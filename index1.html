            1958 to a Hindu Garhwali Rajput family. His family had been serving in the Indian Army for multiple
            generations. His father Lakshman Singh Rawat (1930–2015) was from Sainj village of the Pauri Garhwal
            district; commissioned into 11 Gorkha Rifles in 1951, he retired as Deputy Chief of the Army Staff in 1988
            as a Lieutenant General. His mother was from the Uttarkashi district and was the daughter of
            Kishan Singh Parmar, the ex-Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Uttarkashi. <br><br>
            Rawat was educated at Cambrian Hall school in Dehradun and at the St. Edward's School, Shimla. He then
            joined the National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla and the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, from where he
            graduated first in the order of merit and was awarded the 'Sword of Honour'. <br><br>

        <div class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            Rawat was commissioned into the 5th battalion, the 11 Gorkha Rifles (5/11 GR) on 16 December 1978, the same
            unit as his father. During the 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish in the Sumdorong Chu valley, then Captain
            Rawat's battalion was deployed against the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The standoff was the first
            military confrontation along the disputed McMahon Line after the 1962 war. <br><br>

            Early in his career, Rawat had an instructional tenure at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun. He had much
            experience in high-altitude warfare and spent ten years conducting counter-insurgency operations. He
            commanded a company in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir as a Major. He attended the Defence Services Staff College,
            Wellington. After the course, he was appointed General Staff Officer, Grade 2 (GSO2) at the Military<br><br>
            Operations Directorate at Army headquarters. He also served as a logistics staff officer of a Re-organised
            Army Plains Infantry Division (RAPID) in Central India. He attended the Higher Command Course at the United
            States Army Command and General Staff College (USACGSC) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.<br><br>

            As a Colonel, Rawat commanded his battalion, the 5th battalion, the 11 Gorkha Rifles, in the eastern sector
            along the Line of Actual Control at Kibithu. For his command of 5/11 GR, he was awarded the Vishisht Seva
            Medal on 26 January 2001.[24] He also served as Colonel Military Secretary (Col MS) and Deputy Military
            Secretary in the Military Secretary’s Branch and as a Senior Instructor in the Junior Command Wing.<br><br>

        <div class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            Rawat commanded MONUSCO (a Multinational Brigade in a Chapter VII mission in the Democratic Republic of the
            Congo). Within two weeks of deployment in the DRC, the Brigade faced a major offensive in the east which
            threatened the regional capital of North Kivu, Goma. The offensive also threatened to destabilise the
            country as a whole. The situation demanded a rapid response and North Kivu Brigade was reinforced, where it
            was responsible for over 7,000 men and women, representing nearly half of the total MONUSCO force. Whilst
            simultaneously engaged in offensive kinetic operations against the CNDP and other armed groups, Rawat (then
            Brigadier) carried out tactical support to the Congolese Army (FARDC), He sensitised programmes with the
            local population and detailed coordination to ensure that all were informed about the situation and worked
            together in the progress of operations. He was responsible for the protection of the vulnerable population.
            <br><br>

            This operational period lasted for four months. Goma never fell, the East stabilized and the main armed
            group was motivated to the negotiating table and has since been integrated into the FARDC. He was also
            tasked to present the Revised Charter of Peace Enforcement to the Special Representatives of the
            Secretary-General and Force Commanders of all the UN missions in a special conference at Wilton Park,
            London, on 16 May 2009. Rawat was twice awarded the Force Commander’s Commendation.

            Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, he was appointed General Officer Commanding III Corps,
            headquartered in Dimapur. In June 2015, eighteen Indian soldiers were killed in an ambush by militants
            belonging to the United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia (UNLFW) in Manipur. The Indian Army
            responded with cross-border strikes in which units of the 21st battalion of the Parachute Regiment struck an
            NSCN-K base in Myanmar. 21 Para was under the operational control of the Dimapur based III Corps, which was
            then commanded by Rawat. For his command of III Corps, he was awarded the Uttam Yudh Seva Medal on

        <div class="vgg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            On 17 December 2016, the Government of India appointed Rawat as the 27th Chief of the Army Staff,
            superseding two more senior Lieutenant Generals, Praveen Bakshi and P. M. Hariz.[36] The appointment made by
            NDA ruled Government was politically controversial. Rawat was accused of nepotism and gratuitously
            politicising the appointment, by the senior serving and retired military officers. <br><br>

            He took office of Chief of the Army Staff as the 27th COAS on 31 December 2016, after retirement of General
            Dalbir Singh Suhag. He was the third officer from the Gorkha Brigade to become the Chief of the Army
            Staff, after Sam Manekshaw and Suhag. <br><br>

            In 2018, Rawat defended the army Major involved in the Kashmir human shield incident, where a Kashmiri man
            was tied to a jeep as a human shield. The officer was awarded a Chief of the Army Staff Commendation
            Card by Rawat for counter-insurgency operations. <br><br>

            Rawat had been criticized by the opposition party leaders for making political statements during the
            Citizenship Amendment Act protests. <br><br>

            On his visit to the United States in 2019, General Rawat was inducted to the United States Army Command and
            General Staff College International Hall of Fame. He was also an honorary General of Nepalese Army in
            accordance with the tradition between the Indian and Nepali armies to confer the honorary rank of General
            upon each other's chiefs to signify their close and special military ties. <br><br>

            In 2017, at Doklam a 73-day military border standoff happened between the Indian Armed Forces and the
            People's Liberation Army of China over Chinese construction of a road in Doklam near a trijunction border
            area between Bhutan, China and India.[46][47] After the standoff ended Rawat said China had begun 'flexing
            its muscles' and was trying to 'nibble away' territory held by India in a gradual manner to test the limits
            of thresholds. He stated, India had to be "wary about" China, "and remain prepared for situations that could
            develop into conflicts".

            "swing into action to take advantage of India’s preoccupation with China". Rawat thus highlighted a
