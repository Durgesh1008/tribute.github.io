        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
            centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
            father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
            Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one
            sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
            numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil
            Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
            trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
            pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914,
            however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the
            ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell
            newspapers to add to the family's meager income. <br><br>

        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
            Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government
            of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He
            started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at
            DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was
            interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket
            Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
            successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on
            an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's
            approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

            In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center
            in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an
            effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be
            successful. <br><br>
            In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju
            Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was
            named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet"

        <div class="vgg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by
            three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March 2021),
            Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995). He was extremely close to his elder siblings and
            their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older
            relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.

            Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television, and was
            in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included
            his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will,
            and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him

    <div class="conta" id="more">

        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at
            the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
            discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five
            minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical
            condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the
            intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His
            last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"

            Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati,
            from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight
            landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime
            Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces,
            who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag
            and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage,
            including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul
            Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

            On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state
            honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil
            Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.

            as a scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the
            Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in
            India. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to
            recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".

            In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.

            Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his
            birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state government
            further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate
            and ₹500,000 (US$6,300). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to
            residents of the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of
            students.
