        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            Vajpayee was born into a Hindu Brahmin family on 25 December 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. His mother
            was Krishna Devi and his father was Krishna Bihari Vajpayee. His father was a school teacher in their
            home town. His grandfather, Shyam Lal Vajpayee, had migrated to Morena near Gwalior from his ancestral
            village of Bateshwar in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh.<br><br>

            Vajpayee did his schooling at the Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Gwalior. In 1934, he was admitted to the
            Anglo-Vernacular Middle (AVM) School in Barnagar, Ujjain district, after his father joined as headmaster. He
            subsequently attended Gwalior's Victoria College, Agra University (now Maharani Laxmi Bai Govt. College of
            Excellence) where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Hindi, English and Sanskrit. He completed his
            post-graduation with a Master of Arts in political science from DAV College, Kanpur, Agra University.

        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            His activism started in Gwalior with Arya Kumar Sabha, the youth wing of the Arya Samaj movement, of which
            he became the general secretary in 1944. He also joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1939 as a
            swayamsevak, or volunteer. Influenced by Babasaheb Apte, he attended the Officers Training Camp of the RSS
            during 1940 to 1944, becoming a pracharak (RSS terminology for a full-time worker) in 1947. He gave up
            studying law due to the partition riots. He was sent to Uttar Pradesh as a vistarak (a probationary
            pracharak) and soon began working for the newspapers of Deendayal Upadhyaya: Rashtradharma (a Hindi
            monthly), Panchjanya (a Hindi weekly), and the dailies Swadesh and Veer Arjun. <br><br>

            By 1942, at the age of 16 years, Vajpayee became an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
            Although the RSS had chosen not to participate in the Quit India Movement, in August 1942, Vajpayee and his
            elder brother Prem were arrested for 24 days during the Quit India Movement. He was released after giving a
            written statement that while he was a part of the crowd, he did not participate in the militant events in
            Bateshwar on 27 August 1942. Throughout his life, including after he became prime minister, Vajpayee has
            labelled the allegation of participation in the Quit India Movement to be a false rumour.

        <p class="sg" data-aos="zoom-out-left" data-aos-duration="1000">
            In 1951, Vajpayee was seconded by the RSS, along with Deendayal Upadhyaya, to work for the newly formed
            Bharatiya Jana Sangh, a Hindu right-wing political party associated with the RSS. He was appointed as a
            national secretary of the party in charge of the Northern region, based in Delhi. He soon became a follower
            and aide of party leader Syama Prasad Mukherjee. In the 1957 Indian general election, Vajpayee contested
            elections to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. He lost to Raja Mahendra Pratap in
            Mathura, but was elected from Balrampur. In the Lok Sabha his oratorial skills so impressed Prime Minister
            Jawaharlal Nehru that he predicted that Vajpayee would someday become the prime minister of India. <br><br>

            Vajpayee's oratorial skills won him the reputation of being the most eloquent defender of the Jana Sangh's
            policies. After the death of Deendayal Upadhyaya, the leadership of the Jana Sangh passed to
            Vajpayee. He became the national president of the Jana Sangh in 1968, running the party along with
            Nanaji Deshmukh, Balraj Madhok, and L. K. Advani.

            Vajpayee remained a bachelor for his entire life.[133] He adopted and raised Namita Bhattacharya as his own
            child, the daughter of longtime friend Rajkumari Kaul and her husband B. N. Kaul. His adopted family lived
            with him.

            Unlike purist Brahmins who shun meat and alcohol, Vajpayee was known to be fond of whisky and
            meat. He was a noted poet, writing in Hindi. His published works include Kaidi Kaviraj Ki
            Kundalian, a collection of poems written during the 1975–1977 emergency, and Amar aag hai. With regard
            to his poetry he wrote, "My poetry is a declaration of war, not an exordium to defeat. It is not the
            defeated soldier's drumbeat of despair, but the fighting warrior's will to win. It is not the despirited
            voice of dejection but the stirring shout of victory."

            Vajpayee had a stroke in 2009 which impaired his speech.His health had been a major source of concern;
            reports said he was reliant on a wheelchair and failed to recognise people. He also had dementia and
            long-term diabetes. For many years, he had not attended any public engagements and rarely ventured out of
            the house, except for checkups at the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences. <br><br>

            On 11 June 2018, Vajpayee was admitted to AIIMS in critical condition following a kidney
            infection. He was officially declared dead there at 5:05 pm IST on 16 August 2018 at the age of
            93. Some sources claim that he had died on the previous day. On the morning of 17
            August, Vajpayee's body, draped with the Indian flag, was taken to the Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters
            where party workers paid their tributes until 1 pm. Later that afternoon at 4 pm, Vajpayee was cremated with
            full state honours at Rashtriya Smriti Sthal near Raj Ghat, and his pyre was lit by his foster daughter
            Namita Kaul Bhattacharya. Thousands of people and many dignitaries attended his funeral
            procession, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind.On 19 August,
            his ashes were immersed in Ganga river at Haridwar by Kaul.
