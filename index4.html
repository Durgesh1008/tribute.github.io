                <b>Subhas Chandra Bose </b> (23 January
                1897 – 18 August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made
                him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a
                legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure. The honorific Netaji (Hindi:
                "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the
                Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It
                is now used throughout India.

            Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in
            Cuttack—in what is today the state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal Province
            in British India.Prabhavati, or familiarly , the anchor of family life,
            had her first child at age 14 and 13 children thereafter. Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son.
            Jankinath, a successful lawyer and government pleader, was loyal to the government of British India and
            scrupulous about matters of language and the law. A self-made man from the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he
            had remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his village during the pooja holidays. <br><br>

            Eager to join his five school-going older brothers, Subhas entered the Baptist Mission's Protestant European
            School in Cuttack in January 1902. English was the medium of all instruction in the school, the majority
            of the students being European or Anglo-Indians of mixed British and Indian ancestry. The curriculum
            included English—correctly written and spoken—Latin, the Bible, good

            Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj.
            The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian
            Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the
            routine final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the
            nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to
            leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to
            socialism.[i] Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between
            him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely
            states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude
            to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself. After the large majority of the Congress
            Working Committee members resigned in protest, Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from
            the party

            During the mid-1930s Bose travelled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including
            Benito Mussolini. He observed party organisation and saw communism and fascism in action. In this
            period, he also researched and wrote the first part of his book The Indian Struggle, which covered the
            country's independence movement in the years 1920–1934. Although it was published in London in 1935, the
            British government banned the book in the colony out of fears that it would encourage unrest. Bose was
            supported in Europe by the Indian Central European Society organized by Otto Faltis from Vienna.

            In 1938 Bose stated his opinion that the INC "should be organised on the broadest anti-imperialist front
            with the two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime.
            By 1938 Bose had become a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination as Congress President.
            He stood for unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British. This
            meant a confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency, splitting the Indian
            National Congress party.

            Subhas Chandra Bose's death occurred from third-degree burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese
            plane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan). However, many among his supporters,
            especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the
