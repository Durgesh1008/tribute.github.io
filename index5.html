            Batra was born on 9 September 1974, in a small town in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh. He was the third child of
            Girdhari Lal Batra, a government school principal, and Kamal Kanta Batra, a school teacher. He was the elder
            of twin sons, born fourteen minutes before his brother, Vishal. The twins were nicknamed: 'Luv' (Vikram) and
            'Kush' (Vishal), after the twin sons of the Hindu deity Rama, by their mother who was a professed devotee of
            Rama.[1] He had two sisters: Seema and Nutan. As a young child, Batra received his primary education
            under the tutelage of his mother. He then attended the D.A.V. Public School in Palampur, where he
            studied up to middle standard. He received his senior secondary education at Central School in
            Palampur. <br><br>

            Besides his academic endeavours, Batra also dabbled in a variety of sports at his school, which he
            represented at the national level during the Youth Parliamentary competitions in Delhi. He also represented
            his school and college in table tennis, Karate and other such sports. In 1990, he and his twin brother
            represented their school in table tennis at All India KVS Nationals. He also was a green belt
            holder in Karate and went on to attend a national level camp in Manali.<br><br>

            After completing his Class XII board examinations in 1992 from Central School, he attended DAV College,
            Chandigarh in B.Sc Medical Sciences. At college, he joined the Air Wing of the National Cadet Corps
            (NCC) while he was in his first year.During the Inter-State NCC Camp, he was adjudged the best NCC Air
            Wing cadet of Punjab Directorate in North Zone. He was selected and underwent a 40-day paratrooping
            training with his NCC Air Wing unit at Pinjore Airfield and Flying Club, about 35 kilometres away from
            Chandigarh.[4][12] During the next two years in DAV, he remained a cadet of the Army Wing of NCC. In
            addition, he was the president of the Youth Service Club of his college.<br><br>

            He afterward qualified for the 'C' certificate in the NCC and attained the rank of Senior Under Officer in
            his NCC unit. Subsequently, in 1994, he was selected and took part in the Republic Day parade as an NCC
            cadet, and when he came back home, he told his parents that he wanted to join the Army. His maternal
            grandfather was also a soldier in the Indian Army. In 1995, while still in college, he was selected for
            the merchant navy at a shipping company headquartered in Hong Kong, but ultimately he changed his mind,
            aspiring to do "something great, something extraordinary, which may bring fame to my country."
            That same year he completed his bachelor's degree, graduating from the DAV College in Chandigarh.<br><br>

            Following completion of his bachelor's degree in 1995, he enrolled at Panjab University in Chandigarh, where
            he took admission in MA English course, so that he could prepare for the Combined Defence Services (CDS)
            Examination. He attended evening classes at the University and worked part-time in the morning as
            a branch manager of a travelling agency in Chandigarh.<br><br>

            In 1996, he passed the CDS examination and subsequently received a call for an interview at the Services
            Selection Board (SSB) at Allahabad and was selected.[17] He was among the top 35 candidates in the Order of
            Merit. After completing a year (session 1995—96) towards the degree of MA in English, he left the
            University to join the Indian Military Academy.

            In 1938 Bose stated his opinion that the INC "should be organised on the broadest anti-imperialist front
            with the two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime.
            By 1938 Bose had become a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination as Congress President.
            He stood for unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British. This
            meant a confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency, splitting the Indian
            National Congress party.

            'Vikram Batra Block', a residential area in the Jabalpur Cantonment is called 'Captain Vikram Batra Enclave'
            and the combined cadet's mess at the IMA is named 'Vikram Batra Mess'. <br><br>

            A memorial for war veterans including Batra stands at his alma mater DAV College, Chandigarh honouring the
            services of the soldiers. <br><br>

            Government College Palampur was later renamed in the memory of Batra. The college is renamed as Shaheed
