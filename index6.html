            On the night of 26 November 2008, several buildings in South Mumbai were attacked. One of the buildings
            where hostages were held was the iconic 100-year-old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan was
            the team commander of 51 Special Action Group (51 SAG) deployed in the hotel to rescue the hostages. He
            entered the hotel with a group of 10 commandos and reached the sixth floor through the staircase. After
            evacuating hostages in the sixth and fifth floors, as the team descended the stairs, they suspected
            terrorists in a room on fourth floor, which was locked from the inside. As the commandos broke open the
            door, the round of fire by the terrorists hit Commando Sunil Kumar Yadav in both legs. Unnikrishnan
            managed to save and evacuate Yadav, but terrorists disappeared after blasting a grenade inside the room.
            Unnikrishnan and his team continued evacuating hostages from the hotel, for around 15 hours. On 27 November,
            around midnight Unnikrishnan and his team decided to take the path of the central staircase of hotel to go
            up, as it was their only path towards the hostages and terrorists. As expected, when terrorists saw
            commandos coming up through the central staircase, they ambushed NSG team, from the first floor, in which
            27-year-old Commando Sunil Kumar Jodha was grievously injured by seven bullets (three in the left hand, one
            on his right palm, two in the right shoulder and one in his chest). Unnikrishnan arranged for his evacuation
            and continued to engage terrorists in the firefight. He then decided to chase terrorists alone, as they were
            trying to escape to the next floor. In the encounter that followed, he managed to corner all four terrorists
            to the Ballroom in the northern end of Taj Mahal hotel, single-handedly but sacrificed his life in the
            course. His last words were, "Don't come up, I will handle them" according to the NSG officials. NSG
            commandos later killed all four terrorists trapped in the Ballroom and Wasabi restaurant of the Mumbai Taj
            hotel.

            During the operation, his team came under intense hostile fire, in which one of his team members got
            grievously injured. Major Sandeep pinned down the terrorists with accurate fire and rescued the injured
